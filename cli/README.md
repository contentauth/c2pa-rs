# C2PA command line tool

C2PA Tool, `c2patool`, is a command line tool for working with C2PA [manifests](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.4/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_manifests) and media assets (audio, image or video files).

Use the tool on a file in one of the [supported formats](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/blob/main/docs/supported-formats.md) to:

- Read a summary JSON report of C2PA manifests.
- Read a low-level report of C2PA manifest data.
- Add a C2PA manifest to the file.

For a simple example of calling c2patool from a Node.js server application, see the [c2patool-service-example](https://github.com/contentauth/c2patool-service-example) repository.
