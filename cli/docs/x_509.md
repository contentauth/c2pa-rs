# Creating and using an X.509 certificate

You can test creating your own manifests using the pre-built certificates in the [sample folder](https://github.com/contentauth/c2patool/tree/main/sample). To use your own generated certificates, specify the path to the cert files in the following manifest fields:

- `private_key`
- `sign_cert`

If you are using a signing algorithm other than the default `es256`, specify it in the manifest definition field `alg` with one of the following values:

- `ps256`
- `ps384`
- `ps512`
- `es256`
- `es384`
- `es512`
- `ed25519`

The specified algorithm must be compatible with the values of `private_key` and `sign_cert`.

You can put the values of the key and cert chain in two environment variables: `C2PA_PRIVATE_KEY` (for the private key) and `C2PA_SIGN_CERT` (for the public certificates). For example, to sign with ES256 signatures using the content of a private key file and certificate file:

```shell
set C2PA_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat my_es256_private_key)
set C2PA_SIGN_CERT=$(cat my_es256_certs)
```

Both the `private_key` and `sign_cert` must be in PEM format. The `sign_cert` must contain a PEM certificate chain starting with the end-entity certificate used to sign the claim ending with the intermediate certificate before the root CA certificate. See the [sample folder](https://github.com/contentauth/c2patool/tree/main/sample) for example certificates.
