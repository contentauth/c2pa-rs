The **[Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity](https://c2pa.org)** (C2PA) addresses the prevalence of misleading information online through the development of technical standards for certifying the source and history (or provenance) of media content. The C2PA Rust library is part of the [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org) open-source SDK.

For the best experience, read the docs on the [CAI Open Source SDK documentation website](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/rust-sdk/).

## Key features

[The c2pa-rs repository](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs) implements a subset of the [C2PA technical specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html) in the Rust programming language.

The library enables a desktop, mobile, or embedded application to:
* Create and sign C2PA [claims](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_claims) and [manifests](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_manifests).
* Embed manifests in [supported file formats](docs/supported-formats.md).
* Parse and validate manifests found in [supported file formats](docs/supported-formats.md).

The library supports several common C2PA [assertions](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_c2pa_standard_assertions) and [hard bindings](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hard_bindings).

For details on what you can do with the library, see [Using the Rust library](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/rust-sdk/docs/usage).

## State of the project

This is a beta release (version 0.x.x) of the project. The minor version number (0.x.0) is incremented when there are breaking API changes, which may happen frequently.

**NOTE**: The library now supports [C2PA v2 claims](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_claims), however development is still in progress and all features are not fully implemented yet. While you can experiment with this functionality, it is not recommended for production use at this time.  For details, see [C2PA v2 claims](docs/release-notes.md#c2pa-v2-claims).

### New API

NOTE: The current release includes a new API that replaces old methods of reading and writing C2PA data, which are deprecated.  See the [release notes](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/rust-sdk/docs/release-notes) for more information. 

### Rust language requirement (MSRV)

The `c2pa` crate requires Rust version 1.82.0 or newer. When a newer version of Rust becomes required, a new minor (0.x.0) version of this crate will be released.
