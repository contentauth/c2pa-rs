# C2PA Rust SDK

[![CI](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/c2pa.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/c2pa) [![docs.rs](https://img.shields.io/docsrs/c2pa)](https://docs.rs/c2pa/) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/contentauth/c2pa-rs/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=YVHWI19EGN)](https://codecov.io/gh/contentauth/c2pa-rs)

The **[Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity](https://c2pa.org)** (C2PA) addresses the prevalence of misleading information online through the development of technical standards for certifying the source and history (or provenance) of media content. Adobe and other contributors created the C2PA Rust SDK as part of the [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org) and [released it to open source](https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/cai-releases-suite-of-open-source-tools-to-advance-digital-content-provenance) in June, 2022.

## Key features

The C2PA Rust SDK implements a subset of the [C2PA 1.2 technical specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html).

The SDK enables a desktop, mobile, or embedded application to:
* Create and sign C2PA [claims](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_claims) and [manifests](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_manifests).
* Embed manifests in certain file formats.
* Parse and validate manifests found in certain file formats.

The SDK supports several common C2PA [assertions](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_c2pa_standard_assertions) and [hard bindings](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_hard_bindings).

## State of the project

This is a beta release (version 0.x.x) of the project. The minor version number (0.x.0) is incremented when there are breaking API changes, which may happen frequently.

### Contributions and feedback

## Requirements

The SDK requires **Rust version 1.65.0** or newer.

### Supported platforms

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
c2pa = "0.23.2"
```

If you want to read or write a manifest file, add the `file_io` dependency to your `Cargo.toml`. For example:
```
c2pa = { version = "0.19.0", features = ["file_io"] }
```

NOTE: If you are building for WASM, omit the `file_io` dependency.

## Crate features

The Rust SDK crate provides:

* `file_io` enables manifest generation, signing via OpenSSL, and embedding manifests in various file formats.
* `serialize_thumbnails` includes binary thumbnail data in the [Serde](https://serde.rs/) serialization output.
* `xmp_write` enables updating XMP on embed with the `dcterms:provenance` field. (Requires [xmp_toolkit](https://crates.io/crates/xmp_toolkit).)
* `no_interleaved_io` forces fully-synchronous I/O; otherwise, the SDK uses threaded I/O for some operations to improve performance.
* `fetch_remote_manifests` enables the verification step to retrieve externally referenced manifest stores.  External manifests are only fetched if there is no embedded manifest store and no locally adjacent .c2pa manifest store file of the same name.
* `json_schema` is used by `make schema` to produce a JSON schema document that represents the `ManifestStore` data structures.
