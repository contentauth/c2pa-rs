# Release notes

Refer to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for detailed changes derived from Git commit history.

## New API 

The current release has a new API that replaces the previous methods of reading and writing C2PA data, which are still supported but will be deprecated.  **The new API is now the default**.  Previously, you had to use the `unstable_api` feature to use it; but this feature is no longer used.

The new API focuses on streaming I/O and supports the following structs:
- [Builder](https://docs.rs/c2pa/latest/c2pa/struct.Builder.html)
- [Reader](https://docs.rs/c2pa/latest/c2pa/struct.Reader.html)
- [ManifestDefinition](https://docs.rs/c2pa/latest/c2pa/struct.ManifestDefinition.html)

### API Changes for C2PA 2.1

`Reader` has some new methods: 
- `validation_state()` returns `ValidationState`, which can be `Invalid`, `Valid` or `Trusted`. Use this method instead of checking for `validation_status() = None`.
- `validation_results()` returns `ValidationResults`, which is a more complete form of `ValidationStatus` and returns `success`, `informational`, and `failure` codes for the active manifest and ingredients. `ValidationStatus` is deprecated in favor of `ValidationResults`.

`Ingredient` now supports a `validation_results()` method and a `validation_results` field.

An `AssetType` assertion is now supported.

### C2PA v2 claims

The library now supports claims as described in the [C2PA 2.1 specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.1/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_claims), however development is still in progress and it is not fully implemented yet. 

A `claim_version` field is now allowed in a manifest definition for `Builder` and, if set to `2` will generate v2 claims.

The `title()` and `format()` methods of both `Manifest` and `Ingredient` objects now return an `Option<String>` because in v2 claims, `title` is optional and `format` does not exist.

In v2 claims, the first `action` must be `c2pa.created` or `c2pa.opened`. 

There are many more checks and status codes added for v2 claims.

### Using the old API

To use the old deprecated API, enable the `v1_api` feature; for example:

```
c2pa = {version="0.45.2", features=["v1_api"]}
```

## Language binding support
