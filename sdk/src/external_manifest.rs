// Callback to allow user to change assertion data before the manifest is
// signed and embedded into an assert.  The input manifest_store is the
// JUMBF of C2PA manifest store. The size of the Vec returned from patch_manifest
// must be the same size as the source manifest_store.  The returned manifest
// is checked for validity and consistency.  You are not allowed to change the
// set of manifests in the store.  You are allowed to change the content of the
// assertions in the active manifest.  You cannot add or remove assertions. Special
// assertions like hash assertions (c2pa.hash.{data | boxes | bmff | bmff.v2}), ingredients,
// or action assertions cannot be changed.
