# C2PA Language Bindings Documentation

## Update Bindings.md Task

When asked to "update the bindings comparison" or similar, perform the following task:

1. **Examine the current Reader and Builder methods** in `sdk/src/reader.rs` and `sdk/src/builder.rs`
2. **Check each language binding** for method availability:
   - `../c2pa-node-v2` - Node.js binding
   - `../c2pa-js/packages/c2pa-web` - Web JavaScript binding  
   - `../c2pa-c` - C++ binding
   - `./c2pa_c_ffi` - C FFI binding
   - `../c2pa-python` - Python binding

3. **Update the comparison tables** in `docs/Bindings.md` with:
   - ✅ = Method available
   - ❌ = Method not available  
   - N/A = Not applicable (e.g., file system access in browser environments)

4. **Key considerations**:
   - Web JS SDK cannot access files directly, so file-based methods should be N/A
   - Archive methods (`to_archive`, `from_archive`) can work with buffers in web environments
   - Different bindings may use different method names (e.g., `fromAsset` vs `from_stream`)
   - Update coverage statistics and method notes accordingly

5. **Focus on**:
   - Reader methods from the Reader struct
   - Builder methods from the Builder struct
   - Accurate representation of what's actually available in each binding
   - Clear distinction between unavailable vs not applicable methods

This ensures the docs/Bindings.md document stays current with the evolving C2PA language bindings.
