# Security

This C2PA open-source library is maintained in partnership with Adobe. At this time, Adobe is taking point on accepting security reports through its HackerOne portal and public bug bounty program.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not create a public GitHub issue for any suspected security vulnerabilities. Instead, please file an issue through [Adobe's HackerOne page](https://hackerone.com/adobe?type=team). If for some reason this is not possible, reach out to cai-security@adobe.com.
